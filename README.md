# rawgrep

**Grep at the speed of raw disk** - search text by reading data directly from raw block devices.

## Benchmarks

benchmark script: [`bench.sh`](https://github.com/rakivo/rawgrep/blob/master/bench.sh)

The following benchmarks compare `rawgrep` `0.2.0` (rev `51d3afe`, with `Hyperscan`)  against:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) `15.2.0` (rev `3fce3b5bb0`)
- [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) `0.1.1` (rev `ee85b71`)

All benchmarks were run with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) `1.20.0`, with the CPU governor pinned to `performance` and NVMe autonomous power-state transitions disabled for the duration of the run.

### Cache Scenarios

Each search is run under four conditions to separate raw match-finding speed from the effect of `rawgrep`'s on-disk fragment cache:

| Scenario                       | Page cache | Fragment cache |
| ------------------------------- | :--------: | :-------------: |
| `warm, with fragment cache`     | warm       | enabled          |
| `warm, no fragment cache`       | warm       | disabled         |
| `cold, no fragment cache`       | cold       | disabled         |
| `cold, with fragment cache`     | cold       | enabled          |

### Peak Memory Usage

Peak RSS as measured by hyperfine, taken from the `chromium_todo` runs (representative of the other cases):

| Scenario                     | rawgrep  |        ripgrep        |       hypergrep       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| warm, with fragment cache    | 204 MiB  | 204 MiB               | 204 MiB |
| warm, no fragment cache      | 258 MiB  | 263 MiB               | 263 MiB |

**These RSS numbers aren't reliable yet** -- all three land within a few MiB of each other, which is, I'm pretty sure, just the leftover page cache from whatever ran before it. In actuality, `ripgrep` plateaus around ~70 MiB on the aforementioned benchmark, I'd imagine `hypergrep` using roughly the same amount of memory... `rawgrep`'s RAM usage hasn't been the main focus yet; the work so far has gone almost entirely into wall-time, though, there are for sure some known ideas to bring RSS down without affecting the performance much, or even at all.

### Thoughts

- `rawgrep`'s advantage is largest when its fragment cache is warm, particularly on cold page cache (4-7x over ripgrep/hypergrep). Without the fragment cache, the margin narrows substantially, and on the smaller Linux tree specifically, plain ripgrep is faster than `rawgrep (no cache)` in the warm/no-fragment-cache case (1.4-1.5x). This number, of course, isn't final, and `rawgrep` is gonna get much faster in the future.

- The *Fragment Cache* `rawgrep` uses doesn't require a separate, precomputed index the way approaches like n-gram/bigram indexing do -- rawgrep builds and updates it automatically as needed, therefore there isn't even a subcommand like `index`. It's also very lean: searching the full Chromium tree only keeps a 18.66 MB cache, and the Linux tree just 3.63 MB -- versus the hundreds of megabytes that n-gram/bigram-indexing tools like fff or tgrep require for the same corpora.

- Correctness was cross-checked against `rg` on every corpus/pattern pair: the set of *files* matched was identical in all cases.

- As always, a single benchmark run on one machine is never the whole story -- treat these as directional, not a guarantee of performance on your own workload.

## How is `rawgrep` so fast?

- `rawgrep` reads files DIRECTLY from your partition, completely bypassing the virtual filesystem layer.
- `rawgrep` uses work-stealing parallel traversal to keep all CPU cores busy during directory scanning.
- `rawgrep` uses the aforementioned fragment-based caching system (inspired by [nowgrep](https://github.com/asbott/nowgrep)).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux (contribute to make rawgrep support Windows) system with ext4/ntfs filesystem
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)
- Root access or be able to set capabilities

### Option 1: One-Time Setup with Capabilities (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakivo/rawgrep
cd rawgrep

cargo build --profile=release-fast

# If you want maximum speed possible (requires nightly):
# cargo +nightly build --profile=release-fast --target=<your_target> --features=use_nightly

# Run the one-time setup command. Why? Read "Why Elevated Permissions?" section
sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search=eip ./target/release-fast/rawgrep
```

Now you can run it without `sudo`:
```bash
rawgrep "search pattern"
```

### Option 2: Use `sudo` Every Time

If you prefer not to use capabilities, just build and run with `sudo`:

```bash
cargo build --profile=release-fast

# Again, if you want maximum speed possible (requires nightly):
# cargo +nightly build --profile=release-fast --target=<your_target> --features=use_nightly

# Run with sudo each time
sudo ./target/release-fast/rawgrep "search pattern"
```

### Optional: `cap_ipc_lock` for Faster Cache Loads

rawgrep keeps its on-disk *fragment cache* `mlock`ed in memory once mmap'ed, so it
can't be evicted under memory pressure from a large scan. Locking requires
either root or the `cap_ipc_lock` capability; without it, rawgrep still
works fine, it just falls back to a best-effort population strategy
that's usually just as fast, but can occasionally be slower on a cold cache
under heavy concurrent memory pressure.

If you're already setting `cap_dac_read_search` per Option 1 above, add
`cap_ipc_lock` to the same command instead of running it twice:

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_dac_read_search,cap_ipc_lock=eip' ./target/release-fast/rawgrep
```

## Usage

### Basic Search
```bash
# Search current directory
rawgrep "error"

# Search specific directory
rawgrep "TODO" /var/log

# Regex patterns
rawgrep "error|warning|critical" .
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Specify device manually (auto-detected by default)
rawgrep "pattern" /home --device=/dev/sda1

# Print statistics at the end of the search
rawgrep "pattern" . --stats

# Disable filtering (search everything)
rawgrep "pattern" . -uuu
# or
rawgrep "pattern" . --all

# Disable specific filters
rawgrep "pattern" . --no-ignore # Don't use .gitignore
rawgrep "pattern" . --binary    # Search binary files
```

### Filtering Levels
```bash
# Default: respects .gitignore, skips binaries and large files (> 30 MB)
rawgrep "pattern"

# -u: ignore .gitignore
rawgrep "pattern" -u

# -uu: also search binary files
rawgrep "pattern" -uu

# -uuu: search everything, including large files
rawgrep "pattern" -uuu
```

## Why Elevated Permissions?

`rawgrep` reads raw block devices (e.g., `/dev/sda1`), which are protected by the OS. Instead of requiring full root access via `sudo` every time, we use Linux capabilities to grant **only** the specific permission needed.

### What is `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`?

This capability grants exactly **one** permission: bypass file read permission checks.

**`rawgrep` only reads data, it never writes anything to disk.**

### Verifying Capabilities

You can verify what capabilities the binary has:

```bash
getcap ./target/release-fast/rawgrep
# Output: ./target/release-fast/rawgrep = cap_dac_read_search+eip
```

### Removing Capabilities

If you want to revoke the capability and go back to using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo setcap -r ./target/release-fast/rawgrep
```

## Limitations (IMPORTANT)

- **ext4/ntfs only:** Currently only supports ext4/ntfs filesystems.

## Development

**Note:** Capabilities are tied to the binary file itself, so you'll need to re-run `setcap` after each rebuild.

> **Why no automation script?** I intentionally decide not to provide a script that runs `sudo` commands. If you want automation, write your own script, it's just a few lines of bash code and you'll understand exactly what it does.

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support for Windows. (Some physical partition reading/parsing stuff needs to get redesigned for Windows, besides that the NTFS parser is already working, although it's nearly not as optimized as the ext4 parser)
- [ ] Support for OSX+APFS.
- [ ] Symlink support

## Emacs Integration

To use rawgrep from Emacs with jumpable locations:

1. Download `emacs/rawgrep.el` and place it in your load path
2. Add to your `.emacs` or `init.el`:
```elisp
(require 'rawgrep)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-e") 'rawgrep)
```

Or if you use `use-package`:
```elisp
(use-package rawgrep
  :load-path "path/to/rawgrep.el"
  :bind ("M-e" . rawgrep))
```

Works exactly like `'grep-find` but better.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this safe to use?**
A: Yes. The tool only reads data and never writes. The `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability is narrowly scoped.

**Q: Is rawgrep faster than [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)?**
A: Yeah.

**Q: Why am I missing some matches?**
A: By default, rawgrep respects `.gitignore` and skips binary/large (> 30MB) files. Use `-u` to ignore `.gitignore`, `-uu` to also search binaries, or `-uuu` to search everything. This matches ripgrep's behavior.

**Q: Can I use this on other filesystems?**
A: Currently only ext4/ntfs is supported. Support for other filesystems may be added in the future. (Motivate me with stars)

**Q: Will this damage my filesystem?**
A: No. The tool only performs read operations. It cannot modify your filesystem.

**Q: What if partition auto-detection fails?**
A: Specify the device manually with `--device=/dev/sdXY`. Use `df -Th` to find your partition.
